# FAST_biginner_tutorial

This is a tutorial for those who want to build FPGA prototypes using FAST framework.
For now, I'm still wrapping up things and deciding what to put up here for reference.
In the current schedule, some more documents will be uploaded from later Feb. to early
March. 

Please keep tuned for the updates. If you have any suggestions on what you would like to
see in this repo, I'm happy to talk about them in the `issue`.
